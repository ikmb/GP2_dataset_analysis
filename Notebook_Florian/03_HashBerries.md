I want to study the host metabolism, so I digest the berries with enzyme md5.

    bash runHashBerries.sh  
	cat /home/user/Desktop/uc-rnaseq/03_berryhash/BerryHash.md5  
	26440e799eb1109aadb2e09fa737dab4  /home/user/Desktop/replaced\_berries\_result.txt

Result:  
The berries are now digested. Since this is a final result, it was added to 00_files.md. This example is here to show how to handle file locations outside the repository. In the discovery phase of the project, this is handled by giving the location and user where this was executed.
